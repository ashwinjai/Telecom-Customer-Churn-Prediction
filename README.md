# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview:
The "Telecom Churn Dashboard" in Tableau is a data visualization project designed to analyze and understand customer churn patterns in the telecom industry. 
The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of customer churn, helping telecom companies identify factors that contribute to customer attrition and develop strategies to retain valuable customers.<br>

## Problem Statement:
In the telecom industry, customers have the flexibility to select from a range of service providers and frequently change operators.  This dynamic market experiences an average annual churn rate of 15-25%. Considering the significantly higher cost of acquiring new customers compared to retaining existing ones (5-10 times more), customer retention has become a top priority.
The Primary objective of telecom industry operators is the retention of high profit customers. To address customer churn, telecom companies must proactively predict which customers are at a higher risk of leaving. <br>

## Business Description:
Telecom operators are companies that provide communication services, such as voice, data, and messaging, to customers. They operate extensive networks, including cellular towers and fiber optic cables, to ensure seamless connectivity. Their primary focus is to offer reliable and high-quality services to individuals and businesses, while staying competitive in a rapidly evolving market by investing in network expansion and embracing new technologies. 
Telecom operators also play a crucial role in enabling internet connectivity and driving digital transformation across various industries. <br>

## Data Ingestion:
The raw data is stored in the local file system, and an AWS Linux-based instance is launched to establish a connection and transfer the on-premise data to an S3 bucket. The S3 bucket serves as a storage container for the raw data. Subsequently, a connection is set up from Tableau to access the data in the S3 bucket, enabling data feeding to the Tableau engine for chart development and visualization. <br>
